          <h3>What is a life coach?</h3>
          <p>A life coach is someone who will help you achieve your life goals: from getting organized to figuring out ‘what you want to be when you grow up’, and everything in between. My goal is to help you find peace. It does not mean the absence of some times of pain, heartache, sadness or anger, but less, and when it does occur, you will move through it with more peace, more quickly and emerge stronger and with more clarity.</p>
          <h3>How exactly does this work?</h3>
          <p>Sessions are held by phone. I follow your lead as to what we will focus on. It’s best to try to work on your area of least satisfaction in life; one at a time. I listen, ask guided questions and work to uncover deep beliefs that are not serving you, and are likely not or no longer true. You will learn self inquiry and mind body techniques that you can begin to use with regularity in your life and ultimately you will learn to navigate yourself with clarity and certainty to a life you love. The goal is for you to become your own best guide. Basically I work myself out of a job!</p>
          <h3>Why does anyone need a life coach?</h3>
          <p>I can say with certainty that most successful athletes, musicians, leaders, you name it, have excellent coaches on their side; the wind beneath their wings. Coaches are here to fill in the blanks on areas you yourself are not expert in. You have so many choices about the ways in which you invest in yourself: everything from new clothes, to taking care of yourself, to what and where you choose to eat.  I applaud this. Investing in yourself with a life coach however, can provide you with new life skills that we simply were never taught, fresh ways of thinking and being in this world. It helps with decision making and offers long term positive results.</p>
          <h3>What kinds of problems have you helped people with?</h3>
          <p>Here are some common examples:</p>
          <p>“I hate my (job, boss, life, etc)..  I’m in deep though; I have to (work here, do this, etc) because (fill in reasons). How can I possibly get out of this?”</p>
          <p>“I am not happy in my relationship with (fill in); I feel they should (fill in)... I’ve tried (fill in) and nothing seems to work.. Now what?”</p>
          <p>“I’ve been getting sick a lot.. I dont know why.. I dont want to take medications if I can avoid it. I want to find holistic ways to take care of myself”</p>
          <p>“I have these (annoying, terrible etc) thoughts that I can’t seem to get rid of... Is there any hope?”</p>
          <h3>How much does a session cost?</h3>
          <p>I am taking another exciting risk in this work that I so believe in (I truly believe it’s really only a ‘risk’ in that it is out of our current cultural ‘norm’), and I would love to help pioneer this way of being in the world) and because I have had tremendous positive feedback and witnessed amazing results from my clients. See what this work does for you, and pay me what you feel the results are worth. That’s it! I trust that when you compare these results with the short term results of a massage, a nice meal out or any other way you have more typically invested in yourself, that you will know the right amount to offer.</p>
          <h3>How many sessions can I book in advance?</h3>
          <p>Please limit your pre-booking to 2 appointments at a time. Choose from available times in my calendar here.</p>
          <h3>How and when do I pay?</h3>
          <p>You can pay here. Pay either in advance or within a week of the appointment. You may choose to see what results you are getting before you pay. Payments of gratitude are welcomed at any time.</p>
