          <h3>It takes great wisdom to know when you are supposed to be living life differently.</h3>
          <p>
           I am a masters prepared, holistic health practitioner (registered and public health nurse), turned Life Coach, and I couldn’t be happier. I have worked in the field of health and wellness for over 30 years. I have held many leadership positions, for example directing the Employee Wellness start up at the largest HMO in CA, and managing eight Wellness Centers on the west coast for Google, to name a few. I enjoyed it immensely, until the work loads were simply unbearable. How ironic.. "Wellness work is killing me!" I left the six-figure corporate world behind and embarked on my own journey of deep self reflection, learning and transforming. I have completed extensive coursework over my lifetime with many wellness and mindfulness experts, and have combined and used these tools to transform my own life. I want to help you to do the same.
          </p>

            I have been to hell and back (see my blog)! I now live in a beautiful coastal community in California. I coach, lead local support groups, volunteer, enjoy open water kayaking, stand up paddle boarding (my newest joy), have reconnected to my artwork, and am living a life I love. I would be honored to guide you along your journey towards a life you love, too .. the life you know you were meant to be living. 
          </p>

            How long can you go on as you are now? What will happen to you and your health in 2 years if you don’t take a stand, prioritize you, and make a change?
          </p>
          <p>
            Honoring, reconnecting with, and helping you hone your immense inner wisdom is the crux of my coaching approach. With a sense of growing peace, you will embark on your journey away from settling, longing and despair toward the life you know you were meant to live. I'll 'meet you where you are', listen deeply, use (and teach) many guided inquiry and mind-body techniques to support you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tailor my coaching and meet you where you are.
