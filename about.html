          <h3>It takes great wisdom to know when you are supposed to be living life differently.</h3>
          <p>
            Honoring, reconnecting with, and honing your immense inner wisdom is the crux of my coaching approach. With a sense of growing peace, you will embark on your journey. I'll 'meet you where you are', listen deeply, use (and teach) many guided inquiry and mind-body techniques to support you in your metamorphosis. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a Masters prepared holistic health practitioner. I have learned (and am still learning) from the very best: I am completing my Life Coaching certification with Martha Beck, Inc, none other than Oprah's own personal life coach. I have worked in the field of health and wellness for over 30 years, leaving a whirlwind corporate life behind. I now live on the CA coast, coach, lead local support groups, volunteer, love to open water kayak and am living a life I love. I would be honored to guide you along your journey towards a life you'll love, too.
